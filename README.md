# While Language Compiler
## This is a compiler for the While language in created in Python
### As a project for the course CMPS203: Programming Languages with Prof. Cormac Flanagan at UCSC

Apart from the WHILE language syntax provided in the book 'Semantics with Applications', I will be adding the following features to the While language.
* switch-case
* arrays
 * which can be declared as array(1,2,3,4,5).
* Additional complex data structures like queue, heap, priority queue. It will be a data-structure which people can declare like: heap(1,2,3,4,5). 
* Functions with arguments
* exceptions
* A type-system for while
* Creating a native app as a console for the While language. (which will be done using the Tkinter module)
* If it is good enough, then possibly make it a Python Package for while language for further use.
